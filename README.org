This repository has no official affiliation with [[http://www.TeXample.net]].

It is meant to be a repository of example uses of all TeX systems.
Similar to TeXample.net, these are examples meant
  not only to be showcases of what TeX systems can do,
  but also to be minimalist use cases of specific functionalities.
The combination of functionality is still certainly OK.  =:)=

I haven't quite set down on what I want this to be yet,
  but please feel free to contribute examples, anything from basics to advanced!
This is meant as much to be a reference of syntax as it is to be a introduction for beginners.
