\opening{Mr\@. Duck,}

Please come in for you annual physical.  We haven't seen you in twenty
years.  While I'm sure you have been keeping yourself very healthy
(you are a markedly long-lived duck!), there are a number of mandatory
screenings that must be performed:
\begin{itemize}
\item rabies
\item waddle-foot
\item uncontrolled quacking syndrome
\end{itemize}
Please come in at your soonest convenience.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\encl{a bribe}
\ps{I have breadcrumbs.}
\end{letter}
